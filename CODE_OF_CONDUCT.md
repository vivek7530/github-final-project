# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Showing empathy toward other community members

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at <your-email@example.com>. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org),
